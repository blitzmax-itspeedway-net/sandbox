Blizmax PEG Definition

1. Introduction

A PEG file is a set of lines that define grammar rules and can include blank lines and comments.

A line can be terminated by CR (ASCII=13) or CRLF (ASCII=13,ASCII=10).

2. Comments
Any line that starts with the Hash symbol (ASCII=35,"#") is a comment and is ignored for the purposes of the PEG defintion.

3. Rule Defintion

A Rule defintion contains a head and a body seperated by the literal "->".
The head is a non-terminal identifier that acts as the rule name.
The body is an expression that defines the rule.

    <head> -> <body>

3.1. Rule name (head)

A Rule name is case insensitive and can only contain the characters A-Z and a-z only.

It is defined as:

    RULENAME -> [A-Za-z]

3.2. Rule defintion (body)

4. Symbols

The following symbols are used in the defintion of a PEG grammar:

    #   COMMENT
    <-  ASSIGNMENT
    *   Zero or more
    +   One or more
    ?   OPTIONAL (Zero or One)
    &   AND
    !   NEGATED
    []  RANGE
    ()  GROUP
    /   OPTION
    @   Search
    ~   Case insensitive
    %   Character Encoding
    ;   Character Encoding
