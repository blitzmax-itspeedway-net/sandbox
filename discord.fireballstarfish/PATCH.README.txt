BBDebugScope** bbObjectRegisteredStructs( int *count );

// END OF CHANGE


straight below

void        bbObjectRegisterType( BBClass *clas );
BBClass**    bbObjectRegisteredTypes( int *count );


https://github.com/HurryStarfish/bcc/tree/bcc_reflect
https://github.com/HurryStarfish/brl.mod/tree/brl_reflect

in the bcc_reflect and brl_reflect branches on the official repository


I started fresh again because I'd edited a lot of things in my test BlitzMax folder...
* Install pre-release "BlitzMax_linux_x64_0.144.3.57.202406300149"
* Download "bcc_reflect", "brl.mod_reflect" & extract
* Replace "mod/brl.mod" with "brl.mod_reflect"
* Compile bcc with pre-release in Release mode
* Copy bcc into bin/bcc (Overwriting original)
* Delete "sandbox/discord.fireballstarfish/.bmx" folder
* Edit "blitz_object.h" to add the additional lines
* Delete all ".bmx" folders in "~/BlitzMax"
* Manually compile:
    - brl.threads
    - brl.standardio
    - brl.linkedlist
    - brl.map

Both Release and Debug now run :)
