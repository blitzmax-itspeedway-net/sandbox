INTRODUCING MAXGUI FORMS
========================

A Form is a Definition file that is Loaded/Saved and is used to build a MaxGUI page with minimal
effort.

Initially it will support:
	Blitzmax Form Definition	(*.bfd)
	
Later versions will support Lazerus Forms (*.lfm) and Visual Basic Forms (.frm)
Support for Delphi Forms may be added if I can find some documentation.

## GUI EDITOR
GUIde 1.4 (and possible 2.0) are available online as Blitzmax Source.
I would like to convert these to create .bmf files instead of MaxGUI source code.
	(Shouldn't be too difficult)
	
Later versions will bring MaxGUI.Forms and MaxGUI.Sizer together and allow forms to include sizers.

## FORM TRANSLATION

There is some code (in one of the folders) that attempts to translate Lazerus forms to Blitzmax forms
* This should be finished.
* Maybe do the same for other form creators.
