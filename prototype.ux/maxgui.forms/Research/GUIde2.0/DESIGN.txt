This new version is designed to be compatible with MAXIDE tabs and includes a container application
to allow it to be used stand-alone too.

It no longer generates native code as per the previous versions but instead produces a BlitzMAX Form Definition
file with exension .bfd which can be used by your application using the gui.forms module.
