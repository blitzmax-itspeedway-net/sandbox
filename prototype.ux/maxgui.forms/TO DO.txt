THINGS DO DO

# ESSENTIAL
Form loader must support nested objects so that a form, panel or sizer can contain objects
	Currently this fails
Support for sizer (all types)

	WIDGET
		CONTAINER		Has Children objects and surface (TGadget) to draw on
			FORM		Can add Widgets
						Surface is Maxgui Parent
			SIZER		Can add widgets
						Surface is Maxgui Parent
				GRIDSIZER
				HSIZER
				VSIZER
				etc
			PANEL		Can add Widgets
						Surface is TGadget
		COMPONENT
			TEXTBOX
			BUTTON
			LABEL
			etc

# REQUIRED



# NICE TO HAVE

Helper functions to replace those from MaxGUI as shortform
	NewTextBox(), NewLabel("Text"), etc...
